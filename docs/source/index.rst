PSSR Documentation
===================

**PSSR** *(Point-Scanning Super-Resolution)* is a standardized `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/>`_ workflow for super-resolution tasks using microscopy images. It is based off a paper of the
same name: `Deep learning-based point-scanning super-resolution imaging <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01080-z>`_, but contains various improvements and new features.

If you have never used **PSSR** before, :doc:`guide/start` outlines installation and basic usage.
Full reference and explanations of all **PSSR** tools is available in :doc:`API Reference <reference/api>`.

The package is still in development. All code can be found at `https://github.com/haydenstites/PSSR <https://github.com/haydenstites/PSSR>`_.
If you experience any bugs, unexpected behaviors, or have any suggestions, make sure to `open a ticket <https://github.com/haydenstites/PSSR/issues>`_.
